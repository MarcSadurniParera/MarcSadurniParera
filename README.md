## Welcome to my personal profile! ##

Hi, I am [Marc Sadurn√≠](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcsadurn√≠/), a PhD researcher in Physics of Complex Systems at Universitat de Barcelona Institute of Complex Systems (UBICS). My research involves exploring agent-based models, stochastic processes, and continuous-time random walks formalisms to raise new mathematical formulations addressing issues related to inequalities, segregation, mobility, and welfare in cities. This endeavor is closely tied to leveraging statistical physics tools and approaches, such as those associated with phase transitions. Additionally, I am also a visiting research scientist at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna (CSH) and a member of the Computational Social Science and Network Inequality group. My research interests in the CSH have focused on investigating social geographic segregation patterns among diverse migrant populations in Vienna through the application of complex networks, clustering and stochastic algorithms driven by real datasets to enhance comprehension of cultural homophily and income disparities in urban areas.
